# SQL-Project-on-Murder-Mystery
This project uses SQL to investigate a fictional crime by querying multiple tables. It identifies suspects, analyzes check-ins, links people to vehicles, and extracts key details using joins, CTEs, and views. It demonstrates practical SQL skills for solving complex data problems

# SQL Crime Investigation Project
This project is an investigative SQL case study designed to simulate real-world data analysis using SQL queries. By exploring a fictional murder mystery, the project demonstrates how to extract actionable insights from multiple relational tables such as 'crime_scene', 'getfitnow_members', 'getfitnow_check_in', 'person', 'drivers_license', and 'interviews'. The database is queried to answer a series of investigative business questions, ranging from identifying crime scene details, tracking check-ins at the gym on the day of the crime, and analyzing suspicious patterns, to connecting individuals with their vehicles and interview statements.

The project starts by identifying the murder scene using a simple 'WHERE' clause, and then dives deeper using 'JOINs', 'CTEs', and 'views' to track suspect movement, check-in patterns, and personal data. One query reveals who checked into the gym on the day of the crime, while another attempts to identify a suspect who may have left the gym immediately after checking in. Thereâ€™s also analysis of who lives on a particular street, who owns a Ford, who was interviewed regarding a crime in Springfield, and which members joined in a certain year with name pattern conditions.

The SQL scripts showcase practical use of filtering, grouping, ordering, subqueries, view creation, and common table expressions (CTEs) in solving a complex problem. This approach highlights key data analytics skills and SQL proficiency, making it ideal for students, analysts, or job seekers aiming to demonstrate their database querying capabilities through a story-driven dataset.

To run the project, simply execute the SQL queries within a MySQL-compatible environment after loading the appropriate tables. This project not only strengthens SQL logic but also shows how structured queries can be used to uncover facts, spot inconsistencies, and build a narrative from data.
